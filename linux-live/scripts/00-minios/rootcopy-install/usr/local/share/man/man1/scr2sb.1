.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scr2sb
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]... \fI\,--script=FILE\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Packages a module from changes made by an installation script.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-directory\fR=\fI\,DIR\/\fR
copy contents of DIR to the root of the module
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,FILE\/\fR
use FILE as the filename for the module
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-level\fR=\fI\,LEVEL\/\fR
use LEVEL as the filter level
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-script\fR=\fI\,FILE\/\fR
use FILE as the installation script
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
display version information and exit
.SH CREATING MODULES
.TP
1. Run the script with root privileges using the sudo command.
.TP
2. Specify the installation script using the \fB\-\-script\fR=\fI\,FILE\/\fR option, where FILE is the path to the installation script.
.TP
3. Optionally, you can specify a directory using the \fB\-\-directory\fR=\fI\,DIR\/\fR option, where DIR is the path to the directory. The contents of this directory will be copied to the overlay filesystem before running the installation script.
.TP
4. Optionally, you can specify a filename for saving changes using the \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,FILE\/\fR option, where FILE is the filename. If this option is not specified, the filename will be generated automatically based on the name of the installation script.
.TP
5. Optionally, you can specify a filtering level using the \fB\-\-level\fR=\fI\,LEVEL\/\fR option, where LEVEL is a numeric value. This option is used to filter overlay filesystem layers.
.TP
If you do not specify options --directory, --file, and --level, they are not used. If you do not specify option --file, then a filename for saving changes is generated automatically based on the name of the installation script.
.TP
The filtering level is used to filter overlay filesystem layers. For example, if you specify a filtering level of 3 using option --level=3, then all overlay filesystem layers with a number greater than 3 will be filtered out and module assembly will be launched based on modules with numbers 00-03. In MiniOS number 03 has module 03-xorg, which means that assembled module will be able to work both in system where modules with larger layer numbers are absent and with presence of such modules since it will include all packages necessary for work on basis of 3rd level.
.TP
The installation script specified using option --script can be any executable script that performs desired installation steps. The script will be run in chroot environment inside overlay filesystem so it should be written with this in mind.
